#+TITLE: dynmen/utils directory

The utils directory contains scripts for generating
menu-specific classes which are introspectable and expose all of the
options available on the menu. Take a look at the Makefile's [[file:../Makefile::generate-options:][generate-options]]
target to see how they're used. These are not currently intended to be used
by someone just installing dynmen, as their output is dependent on the 
consistency and format of the menu's man or help pages.

- [[file:gen_dmenu.py::#!/usr/bin/env%20python][gen_dmenu.py]] :: works by parsing dmenu's man page
- [[file:gen_rofi.py::#!/usr/bin/env%20python3][gen_rofi.py]] :: works by parsing rofi's help output
