* List of filters / dynamic menus
** Graphical filters
- [[http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][dmenu]] :: small & quick graphical filter (needs x11)
  - Found in the default fedora repos & in the default arch linux repos
  - It's fairly basic & there are a number of non-standard patches in circulation
    - can't assume that the options / interface will be uniform across systems

- [[https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi][rofi]] :: Has a number of different modes & a dmenu emulation mode
  - Like dmenu + swiss army knife
  - When run with the -dmenu flag, it operates similarly to dmenu

  - [[https://github.com/carnager/rofi-scripts][rofi-scripts]]

** Terminal filters
- [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] :: a command-line fuzzy finder written in go
  - probably the most popular of the terminal based tools
- [[https://github.com/mooz/percol][percol]] :: adds interactive selection to the traditional pipe concept on UNIX
  - It is available in the default fedora repositories
  - written in python
- [[https://github.com/keiji0/canything][canything]] :: percol's author mentions this.
  - The source is very small.
  - Inspired by emacs' anything.el (now called [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]])
- [[https://github.com/peco/peco][peco]] :: another one, written in go
  - has some interesting syntax for changing filtering mode on the fly
  - It is a go remake of percol
- [[https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta][selecta]] :: written in ruby
- [[https://github.com/felipesere/icepick][icepick]] :: a rust rewrite of selecta

| Function                 | dmenu     | rofi                      | fzf             |
|--------------------------+-----------+---------------------------+-----------------|
| prompt                   | -p PROMPT | -p PROMPT (in dmenu-mode) | --prompt=PROMPT |
| match - exact            |           |                           | -e, --exact     |
| match - case insensitive | -i        | -i (in dmenu-mode)        | -i, +i          |
|                          |           |                           |                 |
|                          |           |                           |                 |
| version info             | -v        | -version                  | --version       |



* Interesting features

** Rofi -format option
Allows the output of dmenu to be customized (N is total number of input entries):
 - 's' selected string.
 - 'i' index (0 - (N-1)).
 - 'd' index (1 - N).
 - 'q' quote string.
 - 'f' filter string (user input).
 - 'F' quoted filter string (user input).

** Rofi -sep option
Separate entries on this character.
Note that this separator can actually only be one ascii character.

It might be useful to take an actual entry separator and replace it with some
seldomly used ascii character like =\x02=.
